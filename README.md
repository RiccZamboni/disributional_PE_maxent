# My Paper Title

This repository is the official implementation of Distributional Policy Evaluation: 
a Maximum Entropy approach to Representation Learning. 


## Requirements

To run the code one needs to first download the package for maxentropy density estimation from "https://github.com/PythonCharmers/maxentropy"

## Execution

To run the program, run

```eval
python plot_trends.py
```
All the parameters can be found at the beginning of the script, the policy is set to be as claimed in the paper but it can be changed, as for the enviornment type which can be changed in the environment.py script


## Results

The numerical results are outputted as a .json file a results folder "results", while the plots are outputted in a "res_images" folder.
